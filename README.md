# Bachelor-thesis
The Bachelor Thesis i have created for TU-Sofia. It is an embedded car cluster for Raspberry Pi, created using HTML Canvas and javascript.

The Bachelor Thesis i have created is a prototype digital instrumental cluster (IC), based on the hardware of the Raspberry PI 3B+. The features of the IC are displayed using HTML Canvas and any logic involving them, be it movement or value changes and such are controlled with javascript. The IC is to recieve values via a websocket client, whose server is located in a Python script. Due to not being able to integrate working CAN signals, because of a lack of automobile, I have created a Windows C#/WPF-Based CAN Simulation, that is to send values to the IC. In order to recieve the values, the Python script also has a TCP/IP server, that communicates with the TCP/IP client in the CAN Simulation. For Debug reasons i have also included a variant of the IC HTML that features HMI controls inside of the HTML.
As part of the Bachelor Thesis, this repository contains Specification and Design reference documents in the form of an Excel sheet outlaying all the different types of behavior, that is applicable to the IC, including worflow diagrams where needed, and a Photoshop file showing a visual representation of all the types of behaviors and what is expected to be displayed on the screen for them, respectively.
